XMerchant
=========

XMerchant is a set of .Net class libraries, built against the .Net 4.0 Framework, for easing integration with various online payments providers.

Current Status
--------------

The library currently supports a partial implementation of PayPal's Website Payments Standard gateway, and can handle IPN notifications and create subscription requests. Encrypted Website Payments (EWP) is also supported, but doesn't yet work correctly.

Future Plans
------------
Implement support for:

* PayPal Website Payments Standard (All possible interactions)
* PayPal Website Payments Pro
* PayPal Payflow Gateway?
* Amazon Flexible Payments Service
* Google Checkout
* Authorize.net
* Recurly

I'm very open to collaboration with others in order to build this library up, so if you want to fork it and notify me of your additions, I'll be happy to consider your code for inclusion in the trunk.
